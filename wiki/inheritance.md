# Inheritance
```ts
interface IWarrior {
    weapon: IWeapon;
}

@injectable()
class Samurai implements IWarrior {

    public weapon: IWeapon;

    public constructor(weapon: IWeapon) {
        this.weapon = weapon;
    }
}
```
The constructor of a derived class must be manually implemented and annotated. Therefore, the following code snippet:
```ts
@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Samurai implements IWarrior {
    public isMaster: boolean;
}
```
Throws an exception:
```
Error: Derived class must explicitly declare its constructor: SamuraiMaster
```
However, he following works:
```ts
@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Samurai implements IWarrior {
    public isMaster: boolean;
    public constructor(@inject(SYMBOLS.IWeapon) weapon: IWeapon) {
        super(weapon);
        this.isMaster = true;
    }
}
```
The above also works with `abstract` classes but it has one limitation. It doesn't work when a base class has constructor injections and its derived class don't have any constructor injections:

```ts
@injectable()
class Samurai implements ISamurai {

    public rank: string;

    public constructor(rank: string) {
        this.rank = rank;
    }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Samurai implements ISamurai {
    constructor() {
        super("Master");
    }
}
```
The precedding code snippet throws an error. Unfortunately, as a result of the technical limitation, this error is misleading:
```
Error: Derived class must explicitly declare its constructor: SamuraiMaster.
```
You can overcome this limitation by injecting into the derived class:
```ts
kernel.bind<string>(SYMBOLS.RANK).toConstantValue("Master");

@injectable()
class Samurai implements ISamurai {

    public rank: string;

    public constructor(rank: string) {
        this.rank = rank;
    }
}

@injectable()
class SamuraiMaster extends Samurai implements ISamurai {
    constructor(@inject(SYMBOLS.RANK) rank: string) {
        super(rank);
    }
}
```
