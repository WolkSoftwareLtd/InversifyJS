# Object-oriented design
InversifyJS is an IoC container, an IoC container is a tool that helps you to write Object-oriented code that is easy to modify and extend over time. However, an IoC container can be wrongly used. To use an IoC in a correct manner you you must follow some basic object-oriented programming principles like the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)).

This page of the wiki will focus on the Dependency Inversion Principle (one of the SOLID principles) and the Composite Reuse Principle.

### The Composite Reuse Principle

> Favor 'object composition' over 'class inheritance'.

### The Dependency Inversion Principle

> Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
